@user-nl5le9id8v,2024-01-30T23:39:06Z,0,"Assuming you are buying a property with a mortgage as a primary residence. Definitely not tax free. You are paying property taxes to the county you live in. In my opinion that is still renting. You are renting no matter what. Either from the government in property taxes or from a landlord who takes care of the property for you. As well most people are going to be paying interest from a mortgage on the property. In most cases on a 30 year mortgage you are going to pay more than double the purchase price of the property. This is assuming you never refinance and most people refinance every 3 to 4 years. Either to take equity out or to got back to a 30 year to lower their mortgage payment which inevitably costs them even more interest because mortgages are front loaded with the interest costing you the most the first 15 years. On top of this you are responsible for all the costs of the home which an estimate is 1% per year of the homes value. Usually around $500 per month in home maintenance and repairs. Then by the time you actually pay the house off in 30 to 40 years (because of refinancing) IF you stay in it that long (most people move every 7 years) then you probably have to do a reverse mortgage just to live because social security is crap and so is 401k. So congratulations you were never a home ""owner"" just a glorified renter. The only way home ownership makes since is if you can buy it as a long term investment (meaning you are renting it out) and the property actually cashflows to cover the expenses. Or if you pay cash for a house you live in and plan to stay long term.",g1bOstgCQsM,True
@jupitereye4322,2024-01-15T20:10:23Z,1,"Never rent again, period. I've rented for few years, wasted money completely. Since I bought my first apartment, then sold and bought a house, then sold again and bought a house with rental, I have effectively quadrupled my money, literally. Not only that, I've now cut my cost as my rental unit is paying for a good chunk of the mortgage. I think your calculation is unidimensional, it doesn't take into account growth of value, not to mention lines of credit associated with the property which can sometimes be crucial for life opportunities or unfortunate events. Right now if you calculate for example cost of mortgage for a 1M$ house, it would be high, but the cost of the house will rise as interest rates come down by 2-3%, so temporarily you are losing money but in 6-7 years you'll gain that value back, or make even more. Renting should be really a short term idea. I know people in my industry that never owned a thing, always renting, and now they are turning 50, their investments haven't made much money, and even if they did it will all be gone for another rental when they hit 65 and are retired. What this is, to my eye, is pure slavery. Own nothing, pay for everything to those who are slowly accumulating money. I think if someone can't afford to buy a house, then rent, ok, but why not buy a super small condo and rent it out? Have someone pay that off, and even if you supplement payments you are still saving on a long term by having that property that is growing in value.",g1bOstgCQsM,True

@ya-tekao8477,2023-12-17T08:05:06Z,0,"a multi-millionaire and programmer, has never owned real estate but is considering buying a house.

techlead discusses hidden tax benefits, particularly imputed rent, which allows homeowners to avoid taxes on the rent they would pay themselves.

Challenges in the current housing market are highlighted, including rising interest rates, potential market bubbles, and commercial real estate troubles.

techlead emphasizes the importance of calculating the value of a home based on factors like interest rates, property taxes, and homeowner association (HOA) fees.

techlead mentions the shift in modern preferences for homes, with less focus on customization and more on practical, cost-effective choices.

The potential benefits of multiple home ownership, such as vacation properties, are questioned in the current context of hotel infrastructure and regulations.

techlead suggests that buying a house could make sense if paid in cash, the price aligns with financial calculations, and the property serves as a primary residence.

Various tax deductions related to home ownership, including capital gains exclusion, mortgage interest deduction, and property tax deduction, are discussed.

The overall sentiment is that the current housing market is challenging, but under specific circumstances, buying a house could still be a viable option.",g1bOstgCQsM,True
@danielwalley6554,2023-12-14T02:11:22Z,0,"I use my investment property as a piggy bank. The goal is to pay it off as quickly as possible, but with a redraw in case you need the funds for a rainy day. Lowers your interest paid per month, which makes it a profitable venture (though you do lose some of that gain from income tax). There are two goals: have an asset that produces passive income (once it's paid off), and convert currency into an asset (so that it scales with inflation).

The property is a simple 1 bedroom apartment, the kind I'd live in myself if I was single. The tenant pays $1200/month, mortgage payments are around $1300/month, with $550 being interest, the other $750 is paying the loan off (property is about 60% paid off). Yearly expenses from body corporate and rates is about $5000, maybe add another $1000 for repairs. So the total yearly loss is about $11600 (overheads + interest), and the total rental income is about $14400. So the property nets me $2800/year, while it's still being paid off, *and* its value will at minimum keep up with inflation over time given it's in a decent location. Finally, my goal is to pay it down to $80k remaining on the loan (property cost 250k), as after that it will only take 5 years for it to finish paying itself off just from monthly repayments (the time to finish paying off the loan speeds up the more that is already paid off, as the interest is charged in an inverse curve - higher at the beginning, lower at the end).

Living in it would also work well, as my monthly rent would essentially only be the interest - $550 - as the rest of the payment goes to paying it off, so that's value I keep because I own the property. Compare that to being the tenant of someone else's property of the same kind - $1200 down the drain per month, with nothing to show it for at the end. And the fact that it's ultimately profitable for me to own such a property and rent it to someone else proves that ownership is the better financial choice, at least here in Australia (and at least for an apartment - houses tend to yield less rent). And keep in mind - this is as of now, after all of the interest rate rises. When the rates were lower a couple of years ago the property was twice as profitable.",g1bOstgCQsM,True

@majid_us,2023-11-03T17:44:27Z,2,"You didn't mention why some neighbors have (or pay) much lower property taxes.  There are states like Florida (and I believe California where you showed their data) who passed ""save our homes"" laws to limit their property tax increases to 3% or the inflation rate (whichever is lower).  The home values in those states can increase (or decrease) based on the market values, however their property tax increases are limited until the home is sold.  So the next door neighbor could be paying $500 in property taxes because they have lived there thirty years and their property tax increases were limited vs. a new home buyer who will have to pay $3000 in property taxes because their property taxes is now based on the market value (and of course will be limited from now on to 3%, if they qualify for Homestead).  I moved out of Virginia because my property taxes went from $3000 to $9000 / year (no limit on how much the local government wants to increase it and it was based on the market value), of course during the same time my home market value went up but I didn't care about the increase and I didn't want to move.

@cynthialawlor2420,2023-11-03T17:27:38Z,1,"Have you looked at property in places that have very reasonable prices? I live in central Iowa, my town is ten minutes from Ames (Iowa State University). ISU, as most universities, offers a wide range of cultural diverse events, that are free. Ames also has very nice restaurants, museums, gardens, art shows, plays and large venues for concerts and comedy shows. The population of Ames, including students, is 66, 427. Students make up approx half of that population, so Ames maintains a quaint, small-town atmosphere in regards to low traffic and crime and supports many Mom and Pop businesses. It’s a very nice place to live and raise a family. Ames also has many large companies and factories, so there are many blue collar opportunities, too. With all this said, the price of homes and property is very low. I can only imagine the kind of home one million dollars can buy. It would be a real beauty, that much I know. And, the surrounding towns  offer even lower home prices. With a 10 to 20 minute drive you are in Ames to enjoy everything it has to offer. With a 5 to 6 hour drive, you’re in Chicago, or 4 hours to the north you’re in Minneapolis.

Yes, the first years (say 10) will be a time when your mort is higher than a rent, but once they meet and cross, you are on the winning side, especially if high inflation is a factor.

They all take out an enormous loans for oversized gas pickup trucks that aren't going to hold value in any shape or form because they are poorly built with new shiny screens and paint slapped on to hide it and will rust away. They all get married as soon as possible and get pressured in to buying the most expensive house that the bank will possibly let them buy at that moment. Then that's it.

One of those couple are 32&31 and 3 babies and just move to their second house, a brand new town house of 800k but in our area, young people struggle to afford a condominium of 340k. We were all asking the same question: how can they afford it? They told me they have a huge mortgage but they have a plan. They select new development, they buy on plans which is always cheaper as you take the risk, and they sell after the development in the sector is completed… they can easy make 25-30% in 5 years… and they start again the same strategy.

@artisanhome8980,2023-06-16T11:44:43Z,1,"The monopolizing practice of millionaire real estate investors is unwelcomed in our communities! Buying up all the homes, investors are ruining the real estate industry by making homes less affordable for the average person who wants to live in one. Real estate investors are also decreasing the quality of American homes by not purchasing homes they really care about. People follow their lead, and the entire industry just thrives on flimsy real estate for profits.

Most homes today are overpriced for their value, poorly constructed, covered in cheap vinyl plastic, and worthless. Every house looks exactly the same, so there is no character. You can no longer tell one house from the other in most neighborhoods, and greedy investors are partly the blame.

Builders aren't using high-quality materials to build homes, because buyers aren't purchasing better quality homes. Americans are moving far too often. Buyers might as well be investors, since they're moving every 3-5 years! In the past, people never moved that often. When buyers constantly buy-flip-move-repeat, they lose interest in the quality of the homes they're buying. Moving so often, buyers aren't inclined to care about how homes are made and whether the homes they purchase were built to last.

Those who care about housing affordability AND quality end up with limited choices because builders are just catering to real estate investors and frequent movers. A problem too are the many ""quick homebuyers"" or ""cash-for-houses"" investors cropping up who trivialize the homebuying process and treat homes as though they were mere throw-away commodities.

Finally, I'll say that we have enough wanna-be real estate investors! We need more people who want to buy AND live in well-designed homes, and live in them for a really long time. This needs to happen for builders to revert to caring about building homes properly and well. Real estate agents and investors not caring about the quality of the homes they help people purchase and sell, does an incredible disservice to American homeowners.",b1FEzd9TUDE,True

Buying a home is a scam. Why can’t a developer sell a home directly to a buyer? Also, it doesn’t factor in location. The cliché location, location, location is true. I rent a luxury apartment. I can see the beach and the horizon from my window. Homes are ok for generational wealth. They were great during the boomer years. This is dependent on your home value increasing or staying the same. I made more investing in the market. 

Moreover, you still face foreclosure and foreclosure even if you have paid off your home. That means you have no mortgage. If you don’t pay your property taxes or HOA, they can seize “your” home and auction it. How can you say you own anything if you are left obligated to rent it from the government and pay for someone to manage the community?!

@artisanhome8980,2023-06-16T11:44:33Z,1,"I detest the monopolizing practice of millionaire real estate investors. Buying up all the homes (simply to rent them out), investors are ruining the real estate industry by making homes less affordable for the average person who wants to live in one. Real estate investors are also decreasing the quality of American homes by not purchasing homes they really care about. People follow their lead, and the entire industry just thrives on flimsy real estate for profits.

Most homes today are overpriced for their value, poorly constructed, covered in cheap vinyl plastic, and worthless. Every house looks exactly the same, so there is no character. You can no longer tell one house from the other in most neighborhoods, and greedy investors are partly the blame.

Builders aren't using high-quality materials to build homes, because buyers aren't purchasing better quality homes. Americans are moving far too often. Buyers might as well be investors, since they're moving every 3-5 years! In the past, people never moved that often. When buyers constantly buy-flip-move-repeat, they lose interest in the quality of the homes they're buying. Moving so often, buyers aren't inclined to care about how homes are made and whether the homes they purchase were built to last.

Those who care about housing affordability AND quality end up with limited choices because builders are just catering to real estate investors and frequent movers. A problem too are the many ""quick homebuyers"" or ""cash-for-houses"" investors cropping up who trivialize the homebuying process and treat homes as though they were mere throw-away commodities.

Finally, I'll say that we have enough wanna-be real estate investors! We need more people who want to buy AND live in well-designed homes, and live in them for a really long time. This needs to happen for builders to revert to caring about building homes properly and well. Real estate agents and investors not caring about the quality of the homes they help people purchase and sell, does an incredible disservice to American homeowners.",LzK2rviPo4c,True

Unless you are renting a bedroom from someone for cheap or plan on not staying around very long, the buy option has always come out on top.

There were so many things that ownership has allowed me to do that rent would never allow.

My recommendation from my personal experience...DO NOT buy more than can currently afford even if you're scheduled to get a raise. Bteer to be below your means than to struggle later on and possibly lose your home. Also, don't confuse the down payment with the closing costs. They are 2 separate and totally different things. So you must save for the down payment & closing costs. Do your research to find out what the estimated closing costs will be and don't assume seller will cover closing costs. Next, also save for the inspections needed and DO NOT SKIMP on inspections! This is critical, if you find anything wrong, you can deal your way to lower the cost of the home. Another thing when financing, get a fixed interest rate. DO NOT get a variable rate even if seems like a great deal. Variable rates a one way ticket to losing your home.

@VarsVerum,2023-04-29T17:17:34Z,7,"I would argue the biggest benefit (and downside) of buying a home is that as they said in the video, payments to mortgage is technically still your money because you're paying off the house, which you can sell when need be, as opposed to rent where you don't get any of that money back. However that comes with the condition that you have to commit to a very long term payment plan (mortgages lasting between 15-40 years or so) whereas if you rent you only have to commit to on a year to year basis. So you're essentially paying a premium to not have to lock in to a set location; good for people who want to live a wanderlust lifestyle such as in their 20's, or if they're only temporarily living somewhere for a year or two for work.",LzK2rviPo4c,True

Contrary to what the Chucks and Karens will tell you, renters do in fact pay property taxes, the same as a homeowner would in that same property. The cost is passed on to the renter along with every other cost of maintaining the property, plus a profit margin. 

I am a renter in a very suburban/NIMBYish place, and it grates on me when people with more money than sense tell me “well it must be nice to not pay property taxes.

Just suppose you lost your job after five years and could not get another job within commuting distance of your home.

After (finally) finding a job far away, and having the market value of your house drop a lot, you're forced to sell because you can't afford rent and mortgage payments.  And after selling, the proceeds may not pay off the mortgage value, which means you owe the bank whatever the difference was.

Do you think your decision to buy was a good one?

@elasticbeaver3596,2023-04-25T14:57:08Z,2,"This doesn't tell the whole story.

Rent is often much cheaper compared to buying if you take the cost of financing (interest), maintenance, utilities (if not included in rent) property taxes and amortization of the house. That's not to mention as well that often these homes are in the suburbs amd you require a car or at least inscrease dramatically the usage of it (higher costs). Rental units are much closer to the city center and public transport, or walkable distance or shorter car distance.

The reality is that the principal you pay of a house is basically ""forced savings"", which someone could do anyways without buying. On top of this, the difference between the rent amount and the real cost of buying could go straight into savings.

The reality nowadays is that people accross north America often buy houses to the limit of what their cashflow allows and cannot save money aside from the ""forced saving"" on their house and therefore live ""paycheck to paycheck"" because they bought something way too expensive.

Good basic financial advice should be to save 20-30% of your pre-tax income in financial assets for retirement/general savings and ONLY AFTER if you have extra money to buy a house (provided that the cost would be lower than rebt depending on you situation - e.i a family).",LzK2rviPo4c,True

@heatherhamilton8610,2024-02-29T12:53:43Z,0,"You're making the assumption that rent won't increase, which is highly unlikely, whereas a mortgage price is pretty steady (pending renewal rates I suppose). I'm sure people in Toronto or Vancouver, who were able to buy 15 years ago but didn't because of calculations like this, regret it in today's market. This analysis has the flaw that it looks at TODAY's market only (I know you can't predict the future, but you can pretty much count on rent increases over time). Also, there are a lot of emotions involved in renting vs buying that relate to feelings of security or insecurity, which may be hard to account for in a pure financial analysis. If you have a home and want to retire, you absolutely can because that house is worth something. If you have stocks the stock market could drop at any time, and could take a decade to recover fully. Sure, the average stock market return has been great over the years, but there are still times where savings are wiped out just one someone needs the money. If you can afford to buy a house (truly afford it without being house poor) then the peace of mind is worth it, always. You know you won't be looking for another place in a more expensive rental market down the road because the landlord sold the place (or because you just need to move - an owned home likely moved with the market), you don't need to worry about renovictions or rent increases. There are other benefits besides saving on mortgage interest, that while hard to quantify are often the REASONS people buy a home (and the maintenance and property taxes is an interesting point because the landlord also has to pay tax and do maintenance on their properties - so you're paying for that as part of your rent price. They're not going to lose money on you being there). How many people actually buy a home because they did a calculation and said ""yes I'd be a few thousand ahead if I bought in today's market"" Probably nobody except a few poor souls in Toronto and Vancouver.
Ever since housing prices started outpacing salary increases (like in the 70's or 80's) it's basically always been a good choice to buy a house. There could be specific markets where an inflated price led to regret, like during the peak of the pandemic, but overall people have made out ahead financially by buying.",Od40MC_HyNU,True

@ICanCreateThat,2023-06-29T04:48:10Z,12,"The biggest variable is the rising cost of rent and inflation being passed onto the renter. A mortgage payment, insurance and taxes could be $3,500-$4,500/month for a typical house here in Seattle. BUT rental prices are increasing constantly and as you said, if the landlord gets a bug up their butt, they can force you out into a competative rental market and you'd be screwed. This is happening to my aging parents right now since my dad tried to say that renting is better than buying for so long, and now we are having to consider a multi-generational household to keep them housed.

The other thing not considered is wage increases. Most people's wages increase over time which works for the benefit of someone with an existing mortgage. That mortgage stays the same with a fixed rate loan. And you can use those wage increases into home improvements or like in Seattle, a DADU to bring in additional rental income and an increase of the housing supply which is greatly needed in this city. Plus, you have equity.

And adding along with other folks chiming in, you have a place you can personalize and settle into.

Unfortunately, the reality is buying a house is more complex than just running the numbers. For instance, when you are buying a house you will consider affordability, the facilities in the area, are there good schools for the kids, how far away is it from home and the list goes on. Also for simplicity sake, there are many factors that are not considered in home ownership such as cost of maintenance, if the roof needs to be replaced, plumbing or HVAC work that is a major expense. I also want to point out that your behaviour changes depending if you're renting or a home owner. For instance, you tend to buy more stuff like more furniture, lawn mower, leaf blower, basketball goal or even own your own pets when you own a home because you tend to have more freedom to do whatever you want whereas if you are renting, your mindset is always set to consider your landlord's policies which is more limited that when you own your home.",Od40MC_HyNU,True

@karenw4765,2023-06-13T20:13:53Z,4,This is a great breakdown to put it simply but It is missing several factors including tax exemption for your primary home and although SMP has high returns it is also added to your income if you choose to cash out. Also the market is unstable post Covid and seemingly more than real estate. Also rental cost is quoted way too low here for Toronto and Vancouver especially but so was the fees imo. These comps cannot be perfect by any means because of how many factors there are  but I think it is very clear that home ownership would be the best choice for those who are able.,Od40MC_HyNU,True
@mrwonderful4616,2023-06-13T04:04:43Z,3,"Great video.  But I also see an x-factor when it comes to planning out these scenarios - that is, most people don't stick to a plan.  You are more likely to skip out on an investment contribution to go drinking with your buddies than skipping out on a mortgage payment.  Mortgage payment is forced savings.

May seem an easier way to reduce costs associated with housing when you are a young couple, but good luck when you are elderly and on a pension and your landlord decides he wants to move in or sell it to a non investor.

However, so instead of owning a home, you rent, but what you paid in rent, which is the cost of a roof over your head, the rent money you paid will never be seen by you again.
